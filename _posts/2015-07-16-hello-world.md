Hello, I'm Uzair. Experienced in javascript, php and nodejs. I ocassinally write code at github and have authored a javascript library [arrive.js](https://github.com/uzairfarooq/arrive). I'm also part of an awesome engineering team at [Convo](https://www.convo.com) where I blow their servers at odd times (just kidding!).

I've learned a lot from the internet and think it's time to give back. So here I am, I'll share new and interesting content here whenever the combination of time and information is right. I might not blog consistently but whenever I do it'll be worth reading. So subscribe to the rss feed or [follow me](https://twitter.com/uzairfaruq) on twitter.
