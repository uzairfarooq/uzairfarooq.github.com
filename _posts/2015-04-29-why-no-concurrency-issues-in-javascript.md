Ever wondered why all the concurrency issues you were warned about in School don't apply to javascript?

Lets consider the code snippet:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var mouseLocations = [];

setInterval(function() {
    sendMouseLocations(mouseLocations);
    mouseLocations = [];
}, 10000);

$(document).mousemove(function(e) {
    mouseLocations.push("X:" + e.clientX + " Y:" + e.clientY);
});

{% endhighlight %}

Suppose line 8 `processValues(pending)` gets executed and processes the pending values but before proceeding to next line it gets pre-empted to process another event at line 4. It executes line 4 `pending.push(document.getElementById("textBox").value);` and adds another value to pending array which is supposed to be processed by `processValues()` function. Now the previous event is resumed from line 9 and empties the `pending` array, loosing the recently inserted value.

That's a race condition, right? Well, that's true in many languages (C++, Java, etc) but not in javascript. Someone may have told you it's because javascript is single-threaded but that's not true either. Even though javascript is single-threaded you can still have asynchronous code blocks i.e. ajax requests, timers etc (if you're interested to know how it handles asynchronous code blocks, see http://www.quora.com/How-does-a-single-thread-handle-asynchronous-code-in-JavaScript). Then how come it does not have concurrency issues?

#### That's because of a feature in javascript called [Run-to-Completion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop#.22Run-to-completion.22)
In simple words, it guarrenties that whenever a code runs (the code could be an async function), it cannot be pre-empted and will run entirely before any other code runs. In case of above example, it guarranties you that when the code block starts from line 1 it won't be pre-empted until it completes at line 10. Similarly, when the async function at line 8 starts executing, it won't be pre-empted until it completes at line 9, ans same is the case with event listener function at line 8.
